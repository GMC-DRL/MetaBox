# MetaBox: A Benchmark Platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

[![ArXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2310.08252-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08252)

MetaBox is the first benchmark platform expressly tailored for developing and evaluating MetaBBO-RL methods. MetaBox offers a flexible algorithmic template that allows users to effortlessly implement their unique designs within the platform. Moreover, it provides a broad spectrum of over 300 problem instances, collected from synthetic to realistic scenarios, and an extensive library of 19 baseline methods, including both traditional black-box optimizers and recent MetaBBO-RL methods. Besides, MetaBox introduces three standardized performance metrics, enabling a more thorough assessment of the methods.

## Datasets


At present, three benchmark suites are integrated in `MetaBox`:  

* `Synthetic` contains 24 noiseless functions, borrowed from [coco](https://github.com/numbbo/coco):bbob with [original paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/DQPF7YXFJVMTQBH8NKR8/pdf?target=10.1080/10556788.2020.1808977).
* `Noisy-Synthetic` contains 30 noisy functions, borrowed from [coco](https://github.com/numbbo/coco):bbob-noisy with [original paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/DQPF7YXFJVMTQBH8NKR8/pdf?target=10.1080/10556788.2020.1808977).
* `Protein-Docking` contains 280 problem instances, which simulate the application of protein docking as a 12-dimensional optimization problem, borrowed from [LOIS](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/LOIS) with [original paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9641-learning-to-optimize-in-swarms).

## Baseline Library

## Post-processing
In a bid to illustrate the utility of MetaBox for facilitating rigorous evaluation and in-depth analysis, as mentioned in our paper, we carry out a wide-ranging benchmarking study on existing MetaBBO-RL methods. The post-processed data is available in [content.md](post_processed_data/content.md).

<!-- To facilitate the observation of our baselines and related metrics, we tested our baselines on two levels of difficulty on three datasets. Post-processed data are provided in [content.md](post_processed_data/content.md). -->
